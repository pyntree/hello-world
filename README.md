# hello-world
A repository for learning Python.

Hi everyone,
I'm a novice with Python. Studying 'Learn Python The Hard Way' at the moment.
After that I have other tutorials lined up, to get in as deep as I can.
Currently going through any Python scripts I can find to better acquaint myself
with the language and syntax. 
Starting to learn programming when I'm in my sixties, is a lot harder than 
people half my age. I'm retired and have a lot of time - so wish me luck!

Regards,
pyntree
